Determine the posterior probability of different hypotheses, given priors for these hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations, and determine the probability that the next observation will be of a specific type, priors for different hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations.

The C's and L's represent the observations, there can be any number of either.
